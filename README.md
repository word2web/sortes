The Sortes Sanctorum (the lots of the Saints) sometimes called the Sortes Apostolorum (the lots of the apostles) was a medieval divination system with origins in the South of France. The text was originally written in Latin. The Church frowned on divination and fortune telling and the quasi religious flavour of the text, with their frequent exhortations to pray to God, may have been an attempt to make divination a bit more respectable. 

Before consulting the Sortes a period of prayer, fasting and religious devotion was recommended. Then three dice were rolled and their results arranged in descending order to give one of 56 possible answers e.g. if a four, two and six were rolled then the numbers would be arranged six, four, two. To reveal the Sortes answer the question would then look up the book and find the text for this result.

This small app was built as an experiment using Chat GPT 3.5 to do the coding and using [a text from the Internet archive](https://archive.org/details/annotatorsofcode0000harr/page/121/mode/1up).
I used Google Translate to do most of the translation the Latin.
